# Contributor Guidelines

👍🎉 * First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute and sharing your ideas!* 🎉👍
We very glad to see our project sparked some interests, and that you are eager to share an idea for a workshop.
These few lines will guide you to this process, about the what and the how.

What to share?
Our workshops are aimed at a public (usually 6-14 years old) who do not necessarily share the same language, which is quite a constraint for the activity itself. We can bypass the traditional language, or use multi-languages sometimes thanks to other visual, gestural or sonor languages and supports. Even if your idea is not perfectly fit for such a workshop, you could still share it, and our team will try to adapt it in such a context.

Also, your creative ideas are welcome, even though they are not complete ready-made workshops, since they could inspire us.



## How to share?
It´s very simple.

You will have to upload a workshop description and the needed ressources (images, drawings, sounds etc.) for your workshop in the Propositions folder of this repository. And then, as usual, fork and Pull request.
For the workshop description, we suggest you these templates (in pdf or in text) to format your thoughts, but we accept any kind of other documentation that you have.

Oh, and if you are not familiar with Github, simply reach us via contact@alola.world .


## Something more ?
No, but we are looking forward to your contributions ! 🙂
Thanks !
