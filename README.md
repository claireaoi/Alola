# Alola
 A crowdsourced platform to provide tools for workshops with children beyond language and cultural differences.


🎈 Hello there 🎈

## What is Alola? 🐙🤖

Alola is a non-profit organisation prototyping tools to facilitate creative workshops for kids beyond language and cultural differences. 

Alola has hatched from a collaborative residency in south of France, la [Hive](http://www.hivers.fr/) at [thecamp](https://thecamp.fr/) and was founded by Julia, [Claire](https://github.com/claireaoi), Aline, Sandile, and Léa.

## What are we doing? And why? 👦🎈👧 


Alola´s community both prototype tools (tangible and paper) to facilitate creative workshops for kids beyond language and cultural differences, and organise cultural workshops, particularly with refugees kids, newcomers or multicultural crowds. 
While celebrating diversity, Alola aims to create a playful moments of sharing, openness and tolerance.
Our mission is to help to foster social inclusion and wellbeing for the next generations. 

Alola´s Open Movement specifically aims at building openly and collaboratively creative low-cost activities for kids who don’t necessarily speak the same language or share the same culture. These would be accessible on our platform, to enable any volunteer to grasp some ready-made workshops, or simply inspiration. 
By adopting an open-source philosophy, Alola wants to enable everyone to become an actor to create a flourishing multicultural society and reach as many children as possible, while benefitting from the energy, passion and skills from any individual. Like you. :)

Online, Alola takes form as a platform which has 3 main poles: the workshop ressources, the tangible tools and the community:
